Problem Description: 

At Community FC, our primary challenge revolves around the complex coordination needed to manage our soccer club efficiently. From member management and team organization to league administration, facility scheduling, financial transactions, and merchandise sales, there's a multitude of interconnected elements that require seamless integration.

Coordinating member profiles, team assignments, league participation, facility bookings, financial transactions, and merchandise inventory demands meticulous attention to detail and effective communication among staff, coaches, players, and parents.

To tackle this challenge, we require a relational database system that can streamline these processes, providing real-time visibility into club operations and facilitating smooth coordination across all facets of our organization. This solution will enable us to enhance member experiences, optimize resource utilization, and uphold Premier FC's commitment to excellence in our local soccer community.
